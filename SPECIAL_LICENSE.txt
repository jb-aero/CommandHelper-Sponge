As a special restriction, by submitting code that modifies the core compiler,
the core functions (platform independent functions such as if, while, for, etc, including but
not necessarily limited to the functions tagged with the @core annotation), 
language constructs, optimizer, exceptions, tools, PureUtilities, Persistence and
Persistence Network, you agree to release this code under the Creative Commons Zero
license. https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
Furthermore, the core language grammar is copyright to the original author of the language, 
in all cases. Note that this does not affect the release license. All code is still released 
under MIT/GPL. In layman's terms, this means that you cannot submit code that adds 
Objects, for instance, and keep the copyright on it, you must release that to the public domain,
however, your code will still be available to use under the MIT or GPL license, since
it is immediately released under those licenses, in addition to the copyright being relinquished.

If commercialization of the software without crediting
you in the future makes you uncomfortable, please do not submit code to the core.

All other code unrelated to the core language that is included or linked to are
still licensed and released under the MIT license.
